# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, helping minimize financial risks and improve transaction security. Using real world transaction datasets, the model identifies suspicious activities based on patterns in transaction data.
Key Features:

Data Preprocessing – Removed irrelevant features and handled categorical variables

Feature Engineering – Applied One-Hot Encoding using ColumnTransformer

Model Training – Implemented Logistic Regression for binary classification

Model Evaluation – Used Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score, and Classification Report for performance measurement

Data Visualization – Plotted fraud vs. non-fraud insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Tech Stack:
Python | Pandas | scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn

Outcome: Achieved reliable accuracy in classifying fraudulent transactions and gained hands-on experience in supervised learning, data transformation, and model evaluation for fraud analytics.
